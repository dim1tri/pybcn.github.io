  <h1>PyDay Barcelona</h1>
  <p>We are excited and glad to announce that we are organising our first big event related to Python. PyDay Barcelona is going to take place in Barcelona on <b>15,16 and 17 September</b>: three days of FREE different activities for the local Python community and an opportunity to spread the word of its existence to other people that could be interested in Python.</p>
<p>We count with an incredible group of volunteers and contributing entities but we still need your help to make this event possible and make it really awesome!!</p>
<h2>What is PyDay about?</h2>
<p>PyDay will take place in different Spanish cities from 12th to 18th September with the aim of contributing to expand the local Python communities. Under this context PyBCN, the association of Python users in Barcelona, is planning to organize some special events during that week.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>September 15th: PyBCN XXL Meetup</b></p>
<p>A much bigger meetup than usual with about 100-150 seats and a post meetup refreshment in Barcelona University (UB).</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>September 16th: PyBirras (“PyBeers”) *NOT CONFIRMED*</b></p>
<p>An informal networking event in a bar where we’ll talk about activities organized by PyBCN, along with some other informal talks.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>September 17th: PyDay</b></p>
<p>A whole day event with different workshops focused in people with different Python programming levels and interests. Each workshop will be for 30-35, and we plan to have about 100 attendees during all day. There will be networking opportunities between attendees: coffee breaks, open spaces, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PyBCN organizes monthly meetups and coding dojos, along with other minor events. For the first time, now we want to organize a bigger event, not only for the Barcelona Python community, but for everybody. We have conceived PyDay as an event to enjoy, learn and socialize for anybody interested!
